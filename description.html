                                Line Segment Intersection Problem is one of the fundamental problems
                                in the field of Computational Geometry.
                                This problem has numerous real-world applications,
                                including geographical information systems (GIS), computer graphics, robotics, and more.
                                It involves finding all the intersections between a set of line segments in a 2D plane.
                                These line segments could represent various objects such as roads, wires, or any linear features,
                                and understanding where they intersect is crucial for solving a wide range of problems efficiently.

Initialize an empty priority queue Q for future events, prioritized by x-coordinate of the event.
Initialize an empty status list, which keeps line segments ordered by the value of Y-coordinate for current value of X.

For each input line segment:
    Create and add two events to Q:
        - One for the left endpoint (x-coordinate as the key) to insert the segment into T.
        - One for the right endpoint (x-coordinate as the key) to remove the segment from T.

While Q is not empty:
    Get the event with the smallest x-coordinate - max priority (let's call it p) from Q.

    If p is a left endpoint of a line segment s:
        Insert s into T.
        Find segments r and t that are immediately above and below s in T.
        If r and t cross, remove any possible future events related to their intersection.
        If s intersects r or t, add those intersection points as potential future events in Q.

    Else If p is a right endpoint of a line segment s:
        Find segments r and t that were immediately above and below s in T before its removal.
        If r and t intersect, add that intersection point as a potential future event in Q if we haven't visited it already.
        Remove s from T.

    Else If p is the intersection point of two segments s and t:
        Swap the positions of s and t in T.
        After the swap, find the segments r and u that are immediately below and above t and s, respectively.
        Remove any possible future events related to rs and tu from Q.
        If r and t intersect or s and u intersect, add those intersection points to Q if we haven't visited it already.
